- Shows the amount of classes a student can skip **safely** without falling below the selected attendance percentage.
- Shows the amount of classes a student need to attend in-order to reach a selected attendance percentage.
- Etlab rounds off the attendance, however I've not. So the users get the exact attendance percentage and the classes they'll have to attend, if they are short of attendance.
